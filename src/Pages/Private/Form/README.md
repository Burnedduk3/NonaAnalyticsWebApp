# Form
This is the most important page of the application, is where the user will be most of the time.

It is composed by two folders,

* ## Survey
The survey component will fetch the questions using the previously described hooks and display the right components for the right questions
the idea is to maintain the same height of the screen, so the user won't scroll and to update the answers or progress.
